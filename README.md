# Long-Haul-DWDM-Fiber-Network-Design-Using-Cisco-Optical-Network-Planner

Designed a scalable, high-capacity Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transport system for a simulated 1,000 km fiber route using Cisco's Optical Network Planner. The project focused on optimizing spectral efficiency, minimizing signal degradation, and ensuring resiliency and reach across the optical backbone.

# Long-Haul-DWDM-Fiber-Network-Design-Using-Cisco-Optical-Network-Planner

Designed a scalable, high-capacity Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transport system for a simulated 1,000 km fiber route using Cisco's Optical Network Planner. The project focused on optimizing spectral efficiency, minimizing signal degradation, and ensuring resiliency and reach across the optical backbone.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives: Long-Haul DWDM Backbone Design

- ðŸš€ **Design a scalable DWDM backbone** capable of supporting both **100 Gbps** and **400 Gbps** wavelength services across long-haul fiber routes.

- ðŸ“Š **Evaluate optical performance metrics**, including:
  - Optical Power Budget
  - OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
  - Chromatic Dispersion

- ðŸ”§ **Simulate amplifier placement** and **span loss compensation** for each fiber segment to ensure signal integrity across the entire route.

- ðŸ“¦ **Translate the design** into **vendor-aligned configurations** suitable for real-world deployment (e.g., TL1 commands, ROADM planning, and interface parameters).
